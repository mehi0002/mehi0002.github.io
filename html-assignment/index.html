          Maddy is a 36-year-old non-binary person. They are the 3<sup>rd</sup> in a set of fraternal triplets, having 2 
          two “older”<sup> 1</sup> sisters. Their favourite colour is blue; their favourite food is sushi; and 
          their favourite animals are bunnies. They are an experienced barista, and an accomplished hobby 
          mixologist. They have a love for theatre and film as well as role playing games; they are drawn to 
          these mediums because it facilitates a creative narrative. Their favourite director is Taika Waititi

        <p>
          In high school Maddy enjoyed computer programming, photography, and media/film classes, which 
          influenced them to pursue a Bachelor of Computing with an area of application in studio art from 
          <abbr title="The University of Guelph">UoG</abbr>. During the program they were drawn towards 
          <abbr title="Human Computer Interation">HCI</abbr> because of the interplay between technology and 
          human psychology. The highlight of those 4 years was getting into a hack battle with a 4chan troll 
          from Berkley. Pre-pandemic Maddy was working as a stagehand and warehouse associate in the live 
          events/audio-visual industry and volunteering at theatre festivals when they had free time.
