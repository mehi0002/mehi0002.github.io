      <!-- Can I just say, that I had first learned HTML and CSS back in the early 2000s and holy shit
      HTML5 has improved everything so much! I really like the new semantic tags rather than just making
      divs for everything (and before that it was tables and frames... I am dating myself...)  -->

          mixologist. They have a love for theatre and film as well as role playing games; they are drawn to

          In high school Maddy enjoyed computer programming, photography, and media/film classes, which 
          influenced them to pursue a Bachelor of Computing with an area of application in studio art from 
          <abbr title="The University of Guelph">UoG</abbr>. During the program they were drawn towards 
          <abbr title="Human Computer Interation">HCI</abbr> because of the interplay between technology and 
          human psychology. The highlight of those 4 years was getting into a hack battle with a 4chan troll 
          from Berkley. Pre-pandemic Maddy was working as a stagehand and warehouse associate in the live 
          events/audio-visual industry and volunteering at theatre festivals when they had free time.
